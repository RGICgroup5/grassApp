grassApp
========
The GrassApp is an app which can be used to assess fauna damage on grass. 
It is developed by Sander van der Drift, Sabina Rosca, Bastiaen Boekelo, Kristin Abraham and Bouke Pieter Ottow. It is done
for a project 'Academic Consultancy Training' which is part of the master Geo-Information Science at Wageningen University. 
The commisioners for this project are Faunafonds, Overheul and Alterra.

In order to be able to use the app some case data is needed. A build version (apk file) of the app including some test data
can be downloaded here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ntu8ghqtuh3kxuv/AADGqLqENiBN0KmRf9JanKVPa
